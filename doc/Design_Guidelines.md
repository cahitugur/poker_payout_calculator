You are assisting with UI development for a poker utility app (cash game payout calculator + side pot calculator).

TECH STACK:
- Plain HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Small custom component layer using @layer components
- No React, no Vue, no framework-specific abstractions

DESIGN SYSTEM RULES:
- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes consistently
- Do NOT use inline styles
- Do NOT invent new colors, spacing, or font sizes outside the design tokens
- Prefer reusable component classes over repeating long utility chains
- All UI elements must feel like they belong to the same app

DESIGN TOKENS (examples – reuse consistently):
- Colors: neutral dark background, high-contrast text, one primary accent
- Border radius: rounded-lg for inputs, buttons, cards
- Spacing scale: small (8px), medium (12px), large (16px+)
- Typography: readable numeric-heavy layout, no decorative fonts

CUSTOM COMPONENTS:
Define and reuse components such as:
- .btn-primary, .btn-secondary
- .input-field
- .select-field
- .card
- .table-row
- .section-header

Use @layer components with @apply to define these once and reuse everywhere.

POKER-SPECIFIC UI PRINCIPLES (IMPORTANT):
- Optimized for live poker tables and low-light environments
- Dark mode by default
- High contrast between background and text
- Large tap targets (minimum ~36px height)
- Clear numeric alignment (right-align numbers where appropriate)
- Minimal animations or transitions
- No visual clutter, no flashy gradients
- Trustworthy, calm, utility-first appearance

UX RULES:
- Prioritize speed and clarity over aesthetics
- Inputs should be easy to edit quickly
- Buttons should clearly indicate primary actions (e.g. Calculate, Reset)
- Layouts should work well on small screens and one-handed use
- Avoid unnecessary modals or interruptions

OUTPUT EXPECTATIONS:
- Produce clean HTML using Tailwind classes
- If introducing a new UI pattern, define it as a reusable component
- Ensure visual consistency between payout calculator and side pot calculator
- Code should be easy to maintain and refactor later

Do not explain Tailwind basics.
Do not over-engineer.
Focus on consistency, clarity, and poker-table usability.
