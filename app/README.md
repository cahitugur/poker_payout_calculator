# Poker Payout Calculator (Capacitor-ready)

This folder contains the refactored, future-proof app structure for Capacitor.

## Structure

- `core/`: calculator logic and shared helpers
- `ui/`: HTML + CSS for the calculators
- `platform/capacitor/`: placeholder for Capacitor platform output

## Open the UI

Open `ui/index.html` for the payout calculator, and navigate to the Side Pot calculator via the menu or directly at `ui/side-pot.html`.

## Notes

- The app is dark-mode by default and optimized for poker table use.
- Shared icons and footer injection are handled in `core/shared-icons.js`.
